The project is degined to be compiled with the makefile include.  
No arguments are needed, just type "make".

Alternatively, the project files can be compiled individually with the following steps:
	g++ -c -std=c++11 KV_converter.cpp
	g++ -c -std=c++11 main.cpp
	g++ -o converter KV_converter.o main.o
	
Sucsessful compilation will yeild an executable called "converter."
This executable takes one argument, the name of the conversion table
to be loaded, including the file extension.  
In this case, it is "DT670_conversion.tbl"

eg: ./converter DT670_conversion.tbl

All output is displayed in the terminal window.

Enjoy,
